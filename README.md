## Inspiration

How great would it be to not have to buy a new calendar every year? Of course, smartphones already do that for us. However, phone screens perhaps arenâ€™t as natural a place for a calendar to be located in than, say, a wall in your living space. AR/MR apps should be able to easily integrate with existing calendar apps, making them usable in more traditional ways.



## What it does

Many schools and universities provide students with the option to book rooms for collaboration. In these rooms large or small groups can work on innovative projects, plan for club events, and so much more. Unfortunately, these rooms do not provide students with calendars or other planning resources. That is where calendAR comes in to play, calendAR is an augmented reality calendar that users can access via the calendAR app or the QRcode provided my group leaders. This augmented reality application allows all students or members to easily access the calendar that holds important dates and information.

## How we built it
* [Echo-AR]() - Augmented Reality Cloud Platform that delivers our AR content 

## Challenges we ran into

* Working remotely was a burdensome challenge for us because we could not coordinate as well as if we were working together in person. To keep up to date, we needed to communicate effectively via Discord.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of

* Overcoming the above challenges was our biggest accomplishment.
* Utilizing the knowledge we gained from the workshops to create our application.
* Being able to work together and produce something despite our major time zone differences and limited time.
* Being able to bring all of our unique educational backgrounds to produce a product.
* Stepping out of our comfort zones to work with Augmented Reality

## What we learned

We learned how to use the EchoAR platform for the first time, and how to work together with different skill sets. In addition, we learned that many tools and libraries like Unity exist that can be used to make our project a reality.

## What's next for calendAR

* In the future, we are hoping to implement more tools to the calendar that would allow mulitple users to to edit it simultaneously. 
* We would like to give users the option to edit via mobile app, as well. 
* We hope to add Trello-like project management aspects that would allows users to view a to do list / task distribution list via AR.
* Integrating with existing calendar apps.
* Saving and loading calendar locations.
* Syncing calendar locations across devices.
